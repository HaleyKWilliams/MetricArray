# MetricArray
Example code
This project for my CS 231 class takes ten user inputs and places them into an array. It then outputs the highest, lowest, and average value of these inputs.
The code begins by declaring and initializing necessary variables. 
It then accepts and validates user input for integers between 1 and 100, inclusive.
Out of range values prompt re-entry.
In range values are entered into array, until array reaches length of 10 values.
Highest and lowest values are updated in separate for loop.
Average is computed using a count that is incremented in original for loop.
Highest, lowest, and average values are outputted to terminal.
